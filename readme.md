## Human Interaction and LightðŸ”¦ sensing four-wheeled robotðŸ¤– with Emotion Detection - Computer Vision

A 4 wheel Drive robot car i.e., it has 4 active motors, 2 optical sensors to detect the presence of light, an L298N motor with the help of which the motors are driven and an Arduino to pass the commands by reading the input. In particular, the car has a virtual switch that can switch the modes of interaction i.e., between light sensing robot and human interaction robot.
